    "Here are some intuitive guidelines for object-oriented design:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Look for object candidates__. Your goal is to define a set of objects that will be helpful in solving the problem. Start with careful consideration of the problem statement. Objects are usually described by nouns. You might want to underline the nouns in the problem statement and consider them one by one. Which of themm will actually be represented in the program? Which have interesting behavior? Things that can be represented as primitive data types like strings or number are porbably not important candidates for objects. Things that seem to involve a grouping of related data items probably are.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Identify Instance Variables__. Once you have uncovered some possible objects, think about the information that each object will need to do its job. What kind of values will the instance vraiables have? Some object attributes will have primitive values; others might themselves be complex types that suggest other useful objects/classes. Strive to find good \"home\" classes for all the data in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Think about interfaces__. When you have identified a potential object/class and some associated data, think about what operations would be required for objects of that class to be useful. You might start by considering the verbs in the problem statement. Verbs are used to describe actions--what must be done. List the methods that the class will require. Remember that all manipulation of the objects data should be done through the methods you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Refine the nontrivial methods__. Some methods will look like they can be accomplished with a few lines of code, while others will require considerable work to develop an algorithm. Use top-down design and stepweise refinement to flesh out the details of the more difficult methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Design Iteratively__. As you work through the design, you will bounce back and forth between designing new classes and adding methods to existing classes. Work on whatever seems to be demanding your attention. No one designs a program top to bottom in a linear, systematic fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Try out alternatives__. Good design involves a lot of trial and error. Don't be afraid to scrap your approach and try something new. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. __Keep it simple__. At each step in the design try to find the simplest approach that will solve the problem at hand."

    "## Case study: Racquetball simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Candidate objects and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to refactor the code for the racquetball simulator we made using objects and classes. First we need to find a set of objects that could be useful in solving this problem. Our problem statement:<br>\n",
    "We need to simulate a series of racquetball games between two players and record some statistics about the series of games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right off the bat the problem statement gives us an idea on how to divide up this work. We need to do two basic things: Simulate a racquetball game and keep track of some statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tackling the simulation first, we can use a class to represent one game of racquetball. The game will have to keep track of the information about players, which are the probabilities that they'll win a serve. This suggests a class--let's call is RBallGame-- with a constructor that requires parameters for the probabilities of the two players. Now what does our program need to do with this racquetball game? It needs to _play_ it. This will give us one of the methods for our class. We need a play method that simulates until the game is over. We can create and play a game with just two lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "theGame = RBallGame(probA,probB)\n",
    "theGame.play()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate multiple games we'll wrap this in a for loop. Next we need an object to keep track of the statistics for the game. It needs to initialize some variables for us at the start too, winsA, winsB, shutoutsA,shutoutsB. We'll need a way to update the counts as each new game is simulated so we'll need an update method. Finally, we'll need a method to print the statistics. Most of the details have been pushed off to the definitions of our classes but so far we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    printIntro()\n",
    "    probA,probB,n= getInputs()\n",
    "    stats = SimStats()\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        theGame = RBallGame(probA,probB)\n",
    "        theGame.play()\n",
    "        stats.update(theGame)\n",
    "    stats.printReport()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing SimStats\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor for SimStats just needs to initialize four instance variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class SimStats:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.winsA = 0\n",
    "        self.winsB = 0\n",
    "        self.shutsA = 0\n",
    "        self.shutsB = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll have to create the update method. It will take a game as a normal parameter and must update the four counts accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def update(self,aGame):\n",
    "    a,b = aGame.getScores()\n",
    "    if a>b:\n",
    "        self.winsA += 1\n",
    "        if b == 0:\n",
    "            self.shutsA += 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        self.winsB += 1\n",
    "        if a ==0:\n",
    "            self.shutsB += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to know the final score of the game but this information resides within aGame. Remember, it is bad practice to access the instance variables of aGame directly so we'll propose a method to return the scores. Now that we've laid out the logic for updating game scores we just need to implement a print function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing RBallGame\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've finished up SimStats we'll focus on RBallGame. We've decided that the constructor for this class will require two parameters which are probsA and probsB, a play method, and a getScores method. What information does this class need to know for playing the game? We need to know the probabilities of each player, the player that is serving and the score for each player. Outlining the object this way we might have uncovered a new object, players. The probability and score are properties related particularly to _players_, while the server is a property of the _game_ between two players. \n",
    "\n",
    "If they players are objects then we'll need another class to define them. A Player object will keep track of its probability and current score. When a player is created we'll supply their probability and initialize their score as 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class RBallGame:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self,probA.probB):\n",
    "        self.playerA = Player(probA)\n",
    "        self.playerB = Player(probB)\n",
    "        self.server = self.playerA\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've created the RBallGame class we need to figure out how to play it. We'll look back at our previous function and implement the same loop. The only change should be the condition in the while loop. The decision of whether the game has ended can only be made by looking at the game object itself. We'll put a placeholder method for now:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def play(self):\n",
    "    while not self.isOver():\n",
    "        if self.server.winsServe():\n",
    "            self.server.incScore()\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self.changeServer()\n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "def getScores(self):\n",
    "    return self.playerA.getScore(), self.playerB.getScore()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the loop, we need to have the serving player serve and, based on the result, decide what to do. The Player object should have a method that performs a serve. This is because the probability of whether or not a player wins is information that is stored within the Player object. If the serving player wins we'll need to increment their score. Based on this we now have two new methods for RBallGame: isOver and changeServer and two new methods for the Player object: winsServe and incScore.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing Player\n",
    "\n",
    "In developing the RBallGame class we realized we needed to develop a Player class that encapsulates the servers probability and current score for a player. We'll also need methods for incScore,winsServe, and getScore. The constructor is fairly easy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Player:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self,prob):\n",
    "        self.prob= prob\n",
    "        self.score = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other methods are even simpler. To see whether a player wins a serve we just compare the probability to a random number between 1 and 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def winsServe(self):\n",
    "    return random() < self.prob\n",
    "\n",
    "def incScore(self):\n",
    "    self.score += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "def getScore(self):\n",
    "    return self.score\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The three methods were fairly easy to code. At first this looks weird to create a whole class just to create these very short methods. The point is to break the problem down into smaller bites that are easier to understand. We have all the pieces to tie everything together so let's look at the final program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The complete program\n",
