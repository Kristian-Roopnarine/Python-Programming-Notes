    "### Analysis and Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Racquetball is a sport played between two players to strike a ball in a four walled court. A player brings the ball into the game by _serving_. Both players strike the ball to keep it in play called a _rally_. The rally ends when a player fails to hit a legal shot and the rally is over. If the player that served lost the rally, serving gets passed to the other player. If the server wins the rally, they are awarded a point. A player can only score during their serve. The first player to reach 15 points wins the game. We're going to represent the ability level of players with a probability that they win the rally. "

    "## Psuedo-random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a library called random where we can generate psuedo-random numbers. These numbers are not completely random because computers are instruction driven machines. When you load this module it produces a _seed_ value based on the time and date it was imported. Then based on this seed value the random module will produce psuedo random numbers. So loading this module at a different time and date will produce a different seed value, thus making these generated numbers look random. Using the same seed value will produce the same sequence of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our racquetball simulation can make use of this random module because we are representing the odds of a player winning a rally by probabilities. Suppose a players winning probability is 70% or .70. This means that they should win 70% of their serves. If we generate a random number between 0 and 1, exactly 70% of the values are to the left of .70 and the other 30% is to the right of .70. We can code this decision like:\n",

    "## Top-Down Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Tackling complex applications requires structure and a systematic approach. One of these approaches is called Top-Down design. The basic idea is to start with a general problem and try to express the solution in terms of smaller problems. Then each of the smaller problems are attacked in the same fashion. Theoretically, the problems get so small they are trivial to solve. Then we just put all the pieces together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top-Level Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply this to our racquetball simulation. What do we need? We need user input for the winning probabilites, we then run the simulation and print the results. The basic algorithm could look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "Print an Introduction\n",
    "Get the inputs: probA and probB\n",
    "Simulate n games of racquetball using probA and probB\n",
    "Print a report on the wins for playerA and playerB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of focusing on every aspect, let's assume that some of these parts have been done for us and we'll leave some placemarkers to get back to later. For example, the introduction is a bunch of print statements so we can represent that task as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    printIntroduction()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like that we've finished the first line in our algorithm. Of course we don't have a printIntroduction function yet, but it's something that could be made with a couple of print statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's move onto the second part of getting inputs. That part is also easy, it's just a series of input statements. We can apply the same approach here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    printIntroduction()\n",
    "    probA,probB,n = getInputs()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't have a getInputs() function yet but that'll be fairly simple to create, so for now we'll just leave a placeholder. Now let's move onto the next line which is simulating games of racquetball. We don't know exactly how we're going to code it yet so let's think about what we might need to actually do this. If you were to ask someone how they could determine the winner of a series of games, what information would they need? They'll need to know which player has the better odds of winning, probA and probB, and the number of games they are playing, n. Remember we can create functions that take inputs in the form of arguments. Knowing this we can create a placeholder function for the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    printIntroduction()\n",
    "    probA,probB,n = getInputs()\n",
    "    winsA,winsB = simNGames(n,probA,probB)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing we need to do is print a report using the wins for A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    printIntroduction()\n",
    "    probA,probB,n = getInputs()\n",
    "    winsA,winsB = simNgames(n,probA,probB)\n",
    "    printSummary(winsA,winsB)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've taken the algorithm we created earlier and turned it into four lines of code that look a lot more specific than before. Now we know what variables, functions and outputs we need for our simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Separation of Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "We've broken the original problem into four independent tasks: printIntro, getInputs, simNGames, and printSummary. With respect to main, we don't care _how_ simNGames does its job, we only care that it returns the correct values for the winsA and winsB. The process of determining the import characteristics of something and ignoring the other details is called _abstraction_. This is the fundamental tool of design. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second-Level Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to repeat the design process for these four functions we created. Let's take this in order starting with printIntroduction(). All we need is a couple of print statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def printIntroduction():\n",
    "    print('This program simulates a game of racqutball between two')\n",
    "    print('players called \"A\" and \"B\". The ability of each player is')\n",
    "    print('indicated by a probability (a number between 0 and 1) that')\n",
    "    print('the player wins the point when serving. Player A always have the first serve.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's tackle getInputs(). Remember to keep in mind what the function has to return which is: probA, probB and n.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def getInputs():\n",
    "    # Returns the three simulation parameters probA,probB, and n\n",
    "    a = float(input('What is the probability that Player A wins a serve? '))\n",
    "    b = float(input('What is the probability that Player B wins a serve? '))\n",
    "    n = int(input('How many games to simulate? '))\n",
    "    return a,b,n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice we used different variable names for our parameters. This is okay because these variables are local only to this function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing simNGames\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next function is simNGames which will prove to be more complex. The overall goal of this function is to simulate n games and record the winning player and update scores. At a high-level it will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize winsA and winsB to 0\n",
    "loop n times\n",
    "    simulate a game\n",
    "    if playerA wins\n",
    "        Add one to winsA\n",
    "    else\n",
    "        Add one to winsB\n",
    "```\n",
    "This design is very high-level but we're going to take everything step by step. Let's fill in the information that we're able to right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simNGames(n,probA,probB):\n",
    "    winsA = 0\n",
    "    winsB = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        simOneGame\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've initialized the wins of player A and B with our counted loop to simulate a game. However, we don't know exactly how we're going to simulate a game just yet so guess what we're going to do? Put a placeholder called simOneGame for now and we'll figure out the details later. We need to figure out the signature for this function, what inputs will this function need? What will be the outputs of the function? In order to simulate a game we're going to need the probabilities of each player to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simNGames(n,probA,probB):\n",
    "    winsA = 0\n",
    "    winsB = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        simOneGame(probA,probB)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What should our function return? The next step after simOneGame is to check if a player won the match. To do that we'll need the scores of both players, so our function should return the scores of each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simNGames(n,probA,probB):\n",
    "    winsA = 0\n",
    "    winsB = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        scoreA,scoreB = simOneGame(probA,probB)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to check the scores and see who won.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simNGames(n,probA,probB):\n",
    "    winsA = 0\n",
    "    winsB = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        scoreA,scoreB = simOneGame(probA,probB)\n",
    "        if scoreA > scoreB:\n",
    "            winsA += 1\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            winsB += 1\n",
    "    return winsA,winsB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third-Level Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Our program is coming together nicely and now we need to tackle simOneGame. Remember in one game players keep doing rallies until one player scores 15 points. When the serving player loses a rally, the other player starts the serve and a player can only score when they serve. This problem seems like an indefinite loop because we're unsure how many rallies it will take for a player to reach 15 points. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Initialize scores to 0\n",
    "Set serving to \"A\"\n",
    "loop while game is not over:\n",
    "    simulate one serve of whichever player is serving\n",
    "    update the status of the game\n",
    "return scores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can fill in the first couple of the steps pretty easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def simOneGame(probA,probB):\n",
    "    scoreA = 0\n",
    "    scoreB = 0\n",
    "    serving = \"A\"\n",
    "    while condition:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is what will this condition be? We need to keep looping so long the game is not over. There are many ways to code this condition so for now we'll just put a placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def simOneGame(probA,probB):\n",
    "    scoreA = 0\n",
    "    scoreB = 0\n",
    "    serving = \"A\"\n",
    "    while not gameOver(scoreA,scoreB):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to keep track of the scores. Remember a player can only score if they are serving, and the serving player changes when they lose a rally.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "if serving == \"A\":\n",
    "    if random() < probA:\n",
    "        scoreA += 1\n",
