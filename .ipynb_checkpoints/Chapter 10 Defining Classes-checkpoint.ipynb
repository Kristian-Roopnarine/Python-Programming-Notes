    "We've laid out all of the details that you need to structure the computations of your program. Now we're going to learn about how to structure the data our programs use. Recall that objects are a great way to manage complex data. We previously defined an object as an active data type that can store data and manipulate that data. An object consists of:<br>\n",
    "1. A collect of related information <br>\n",
    "2. A set of operations to manipulate that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information that we store inside the objects are called _instance variables_. We manipulate this data using _methods_ or functions that \"live\" inside the object. Collectively the _instance variables_ and _methods_ are called attributes of an object. Every object is an _instance_ of some class and we can create new objects/instances by invoking a _constructor_. The name of the class is used to invoke the constructor along with any parameters to initialize the object. You can store this information in a variable and once it is created you can manipulate the data by calling its methods.\n",

The Circle class needs two parameters to initialize which is the origin and radius of the circle. These parameters are then stored as instance variables inside of the class. Not all classes have paramters to intialize a class instance and they can be a collection of different data types."

    "## Example Program: Cannonball\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a program that can calculate the distance a cannon ball travels when it fires from a cannon. Some of the parameters we need are the angle at which is was fired at, the initial velocity and the initial height. Using some simple trigonometry and basic physics assumptions this problem isn't too difficult to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing the Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the intial problem our cannon ball will travel in two dimensional space, height to know when it hits the ground, and distance to measure how far it travels. This is equivalent to (x,y) coordinates where y is the height and x is the distance. When travelling through this space only the y value will be changing due to gravity. We are assuming no wind resistance so the speed in the x direction remains constant. A rough outline of our algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input the simulation parameters: angle,speed,height,interval\n",
    "calculate the initial position of the cannonball, xpos,ypos\n",
    "calculate the initial velocities of the cannonball, xvel,yvel\n",
    "while the cannonball is still flying:\n",
    "    update the value of xpos,ypos, and yvel for interval seconds further into the flight\n",
    "output the distance traveled as xpos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's approach this program using step-wise refinement, line by line. The first line is relatively simple, it's just some input statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    angle = float(input('What is the angle that the cannonball is launched (in degrees)? '))\n",
    "    vel = float(input('What is the initial velocity of the cannonball (m/s) ?'))\n",
    "    h0 = float(input('Enter the initial height of the cannonball (m): '))\n",
    "    interval = float(input('Enter the time interval between position calculations (s): '))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That solves our first line, now let's move onto the next. We have to calculate the initial position of the cannonball which is fairly simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    angle = float(input('What is the angle that the cannonball is launched (in degrees)? '))\n",
    "    vel = float(input('What is the initial velocity of the cannonball (m/s) ?'))\n",
    "    h0 = float(input('Enter the initial height of the cannonball (m): '))\n",
    "    interval = float(input('Enter the time interval between position calculations (s): '))\n",
    "    xpos = 0\n",
    "    ypos= h0\n",
    "```\n",
    "The next part is calculating the initial velocities of the cannonball. For this we can use high school trigonometry. The yvel is the sin0 of the intial velocity and the xvel is the cos0 of the initial velocity. Before we do that we need to convert the angle we received into radians.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "theta = math.radians(angle)\n",
    "xvel = velocity * math.cos(theta)\n",
    "yvel = velocity * math.sin(theta)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we move onto the indefinite loop where the cannonball is still flying. The only parameter that determines whether the cannonball is flying is it's yposition. As long as the yposition is greater than 0, the cannonball is still flying.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while ypos >=0:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to begin updating the positions of the cannonball as it travels throught the air. We are ignoring wind resistance so the velocity in the x-direction remains the same during flight. To calculate the x position we just have to multiplty the velocity by the time travelled and add the previous x position.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xpos = xpos + time * xvel\n",
    "```\n",
    "The situation for the y position is a little more complex because of gravity. Overtime gravity will decrease our y veloctiy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "yvel = yvel - time* 9.8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate how far the cannonball travels during this duration we need to know its average vertical velocity. This will just be the average of the starting and ending velocities. Then to get the distance we just multiply this by the time interval and we're good.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while pos >= 0.0:\n",
    "    xpos = xpos + time * xvel\n",
    "    yvel1 = yvel - time * 9.8\n",
    "    ypos = ypos + time * (yvel+yvel1)/2.0\n",
    "    yvel=yvel1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step is to print the distance travelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('\\nDistance traveled : {0:0.1f} meters.'.format(xpos))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've created our program but it is fairly complex and long for something so simple. We have so many different variables it may be hard for someone to follow along. We can simplify this scenario using classes and objects. Suppose we had a Projectile class that had methods to calculate the physics of objects like cannon balls. \n",

    "### Example: The Projectile Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring back to the cannonball exmaple we need to create a projectile class.

Taking this line by line we'll start with the constructor.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've created different instance variables to hold all the prior information. Now whenever we construct a Projectile class, these variables are created automatically. We'll need to create methods to return some instance variables.\n",

    "    return self.ypos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we're at the update method. The only parameter we need for this is time because all the other are already instance variables. \n",

    "\n",
    "Objects contain their own data. Instance variables are a way to remmeber data inside an object. We can access these instance variables by name using dot notation. This dot notation will only access values that are associated with the object. Each instance of a class has its own instance variables, so each MSDie object has its very own instance variables. Instance variables are powerful because we can use them to remember the states of objects, and this information gets passed around the program as part of the object. This is different from regular loval function variables, whose values disappear once the function terminates. \n",
