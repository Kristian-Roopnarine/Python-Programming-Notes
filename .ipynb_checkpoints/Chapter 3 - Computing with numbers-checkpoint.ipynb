    "There are different types of number data types you can have in Python and many programming languages which are ints and floats. Whole numbers are represented using the _int_ data type. Values of type _int_ can be a positive or negative whole number. Numbers that have fractional parts are represented as a float data type. Python has a _type_ function that can tell us the data type of any value."

    "## Type Conversions and Rounding\n",
    "\n",
    "We can convert floats to ints and vice versa. Converting floats to ints can be dangerous because the fractional information is lost upon converion but converting ints to floats does not lead to any information loss. We can do this with _mixed-type expressions_. When performing operations involving both floats and ints Python will convert them to produce a float data type. If we want to manually convert these data types we can use the Python built-in functions _int_ and _float_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general way to round numbers is to use Python's built-in _round_ function, which rounds a number to the nearest whole value. Calling _round_ will return an _int_ value and is an alternate way of converting a _float_ to an _int_. If you'd like to round a _float_ to another _float_ you can apply a second parameter to _round_ that specifies the number of digits you want after the decimal point."

    "\n",
    "* The way a computer represents a particular kind of information is called a data type. The data type of an object determines what values it can have and what operations it supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python has several different data types for representing numeric values, including int and float.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whole numbers are generally represented using the int data type, and fractional values are represented using floats. All of the Python numeric data types support standard, built-in mathematical operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication(\" * \"), division (/), integer division (//), remainder (%), exponentiation (\" ** \"), and absolute value (abs(x)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python automatically converts numbers from one data type to another in certain situations. For example, in a mixed-type expression involving ints and floats, Python first converts the ints into floats and then uses float arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Programs may also explicitly convert one data type into another using the functions float(), int(), round(). Type conversion functions should generally be used in place of eval for handling numeric user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Additional mathematical functions are defined in the math library. To use these functinos, a program must first import the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numerical results are often calculated by computing the sum or product of a sequence of values. The loop accumulator programming pattern is useful for this sort of calculation. "
