    "## Indefinite Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The _for_ loop is great for counted loops but what if the we don't know how many times we want to execute our loop? This is where the while loop comes in. The while loop is called an _indefinite_ or _conditional_ loop. An indefinite loops keeps iterating until certain conditions are met. The general form for the while loop is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    body\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition is a Boolean expression, similar to if statements. The condition is always tested at the top of the loop, _before_ the loop body is executed. A difference between a while loop and for loop is that we need to initialize a variable before executing the loop. In the for loop is variable is initialized in the loop call. We also have to remember to incrememnt the variable at the bottom of the while loop as well. If we don't properly increment the variable we might accidentally create an infinite loop. For example the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while i <= 10:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The i variable is not properly incrememnted so this loop prints i = 0 infinitely. The fact that the condition for the while loop is versatile makes it powerful and dangerous. It is less rigid, it is more versatile; it can do more than just iterate through sequences."

    "## Common Loop Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "One common use of indefinited loops is interactive loops. This allows the user to repeat certain portions of a program multiple times. This can involve asking the user for some input and then executing certain blocks of code based on the input. We can use a number averaging program as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#average2.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    moredata = \"yes\"\n",
    "    while moredata[0] == \"y\":\n",
    "        x = float(input('Enter a number >> '))\n",
    "        total = x + total\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "        moredata = input('Do you have any more numbers (yes or no)? ')\n",
    "    print('\\nThe average of the numbers is {}.'.format(total/count))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use two accumulator algorithms, one to sum all the numbers that were inputted and another to keep track of the total amount of numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentinel Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common loop that may be more useful in our averaging program is the sentinel loop. In this loop, we keep processing data/ executing lines of code until a specific value is reached. This value is called the sentinel. The sentinel should be distinguishable from actual data values and almost any value may be chosen for it. The general form for a sentinel loop is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "get the first data item\n",
    "while item is not the sentinel:\n",
    "    process the item\n",
    "    get the next data item\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the loop avoids processing the sentinel in the second line. This is sometimes called the _priming read_ because it gets the loop/process started. If the first item is the sentinel, the loop would immediately terminate. To apply this to our number averaging program we first need to pick a sentinel. We can assume that no user would enter a negative number so any negative number could be our sentinel.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    x= float(input('Enter a number (negative to quit) >> '))\n",
    "    while x >= 0:\n",
    "        total = total + x\n",
    "        count =+ 1\n",
    "        x = float(input('Enter a number (negative to quit) >> '))\n",
    "    print('\\nThe average of the numbers is {}.'.format(total/count))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler solution to our averaging program is to type all the numbers into a file, have Python read the file and average all the numbers. We've seen how to loop over files using a for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    fileName = input('What file are the numbers in? ')\n",
    "    infile = open(fileName,'r')\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    for line in infile:\n",
    "        total = total + float(line)\n",
    "        count = count + 1\n",
    "   \n",
    "    print('\\nThe average of the numbers is {}.'.format(total/count))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use a sentinel loop to loop through the file lines. The general pattern for this is called a end-of-file loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    fileName = input('What file are the numbers in? ')\n",
    "    infile = open(fileName,'r')\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    line = infile.readline()\n",
    "    while line != '':\n",
    "        total = total+ float(line)\n",
    "        count =+ 1\n",
    "        line = infile.readline()\n",
    "    print('\\nThe average of the numbers is', total/count)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that control structures like for loops and decisions can be nested within one another. A useful application of this is nesting different types of loops, a for loop nested in a while loop for example. What happens if in the averaging program the numbers are separated by a comma with multiple values in each line? We need to loop through the entire file but the loop through the lines to remove the commas! We can do this by nesting loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    fileName = input('What file are the numbers in? ')\n",
    "    infile = open(fileName,'r')\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    line = infile.readline()\n",
    "    while line != '':\n",
    "        for xStr in line.split(','):\n",
    "            total = total+ float(xStr)\n",
    "            count =+ 1\n",
    "        line = infile.readline()\n",
    "    print('\\nThe average of the numbers is', total/count)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer while loop produces the lines from the file while the for loop iterates through the numbers of that line. When it reaches the end of the line control reverts back to the while loop to produce another line and the process continues. A good design practice is creating the outer loop first without worrying about the body of code. Then design the inside without considering the outer loop. Then just nest the two loops with proper indentation.\n",

    "### Boolean Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three different boolean operators, _and_, _or_ and _not_. We can use these in conditions to evaluate more complex Boolean expressions. The operators _and_ and _or_ are used to combine Boolean expressions to produce a Boolean result. When using _and_, the total expression returns True ONLY if both expressions evaluate to be True, otherwise the expression evaluates to False. When using _or_, the total expression evaluates to True if either boolean expression is True, and evaluates as False when both expressions are False. This can be seen in truth tables for _and_ and _or_.\n",

    "* A Python for loop is a definite loop that iterates through a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Python while statement is an example of an indefinite loop. It continues to iterate as long as the loop condition remains true. When using an indefinite loop, programmers must guard against the possibility of accidentally writing an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One important use for an indefinite loop is for implementing the programming pattern interactive loop. An interactive loop allows portions of a program to be repeated according to the wishes of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A sentinel loop is a loop that handles input until a special value is encountered. Sentinel loops are a common programming pattern. In writing a sentinel loop, a programmer must be careful that the sentinel is not processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loops are useful for reading files. Python treats a file as a sequence of lines, so it is particularly easy to process a file line by line by using a for loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Loops, like other control structures, can be nested. When designing nested loop algorithms, it is best to consider the loops one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complex Boolean expressions can be built from simple conditions using the Boolean operators _and_,_or_, and _not_. Boolean operators obey the rules of Boolean algebra. DeMorgan's laws describe how to negate Boolean expressions involving _and_ and _or_. \n",
