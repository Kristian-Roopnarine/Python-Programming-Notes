    "## The String Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is represented in programs as the _string_ data type. A string can be thought of as a sequence of characters in quotation marks. Strings can be saved in variables just as any other data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "str1 = \"Hello\"\n",
    "str2 = 'spam'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do many operations on strings. Through the operation of _indexing_ we can accesss individual characters that make up a string. We can think of the positions in a string as being numbered, starting from the left with 0. The general form for indexing is :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "string[index]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python also allows indexing from the right end of a string using negative indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "string[-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to access a sequence of characters or _substring_ from a string. This is called _slicing_. Slicing is a way of indexing through a range of positions in the string. The general form for slicing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "string[start:end]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A slice produces the substring starting as the position given by start and goes up to but _does not include_ the end position. If either the start or end position are missing, the start or end of the string are assumed by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "The string data types supports operations for putting strings together. Concatenation is the joining or gluing of two strings together with the (+) operand. Repetition is used with (\" * \") to repeat a string with multiple concatenations of itself. Another useful function is len, which tells us how many characters are in the string. "

    "The operations that apply to strings can also be applied to lists because lists are also sequences. They are able to be concatenated, repeated, indexed, sliced. Lists are more general than strings. Strings are always a sequence of characters, whereas lists can be a sequence of arbitrary objects. You can create a list than contains multiple data types.

    "\n",
    "Lists just like strings are indexed starting at 0. While strings and lists are both sequences, lists are mutable while strings are not. This means that the value of an item in a list can be modified with an assignment statement. Strings on the other hand cannot be modified \"in place\".\n",

    "## File Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "One critical feature of any word processing program is the ability to store and retrieve documents as files on disks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-line Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, a file is a sequence of data that is stored in secondary memory. Usually these can contains multiple lines, multiple data types. We can think of files as a string that happens to be stored on a disk. Typically files contain more than one line and Python has a special character to denote new lines, \\n. The new line character is a special end-of-line marker and there are many of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### File Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "To being processing a file we need to first associate a file on disk with an object in a program. This is called _opening_ a file. Once the file has been opened the contents can be accessed through the associated file object. Second, we need a set of operations that can manipulate the file object. This includes operations to help us read the information from a file and write new information to files. Finally, when we are done with the file we need to close it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with text files is easy in Python. The first step is to create a file object corresponding to a file on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable = open(filename,mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name is a string that provides the name of the file on disk or path to the file. The mode parameter is a string and is either \"r\" or \"w\" depending on whether we intend to read from the file or write to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides three related operations for reading information from a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "file.read() Returns the entire remaining contents of the file as a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "file.readline() Returns the next line of the file. That is, all text up to and including the next newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "file.readlines() Returns a list of the remaining lines in the file. Each list item is a single line including the newline character at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a program that prints the contents of a file using the read operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "#printfile.py\n",
    "#prints a file to the screen\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    fname = input('Enter filename: ')\n",
    "    infile = open(fname,\"r\")\n",
    "    data = infile.read()\n",
    "    print(data)\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "To loop through the lines of a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "infile = open(someFile,\"r\")\n",
    "for line in infile:\n",
    "    #process lines\n",
    "infile.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Opening a file for writing prepares the file to recieve data. If no file with the given name exists, a new file will be created. However, if a file with the given name _does_ exists Python will delete it and create a new, empty file. One way to write information into a text file is using the print function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(....,file=outfile)\n",

Instead of taking user input for the first and last name, we're going to load a batch of names from a file and create many usernames by looping through the file. Each line of the input file with contain the first and last name separate by a space or two. \n",
